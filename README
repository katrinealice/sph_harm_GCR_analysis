This analysis notebook is developed for the analysis presented in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13766.pdf. 

The samples are obtained by using the spherical harmonic sampler from HYDRA, https://github.com/HydraRadio/HYDRA. 

The results/plots in this specific run are from the 'standard case', which is a small-scale test case used for our analysis.
